          <span style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: 800;">When I moved away,</span> my parents replaced me with a cat. Skipper soon became the love of the family, but it wasn’t enough. They got another. I was never worth three cats though — Pushkin’s energy filled the house like no other.
        </p>
        <p>
          As our vet first put it, “he has the face,” and if you met, you’d know what they were talking about. The long silky Siberian fur gave an air of regality to its owner, and at first glance, perhaps a hint of condescension towards everyone and everything else. I often would look at Pushkin only to feel an immediate wave of disapproval from the cat, but this was short lived as his impulse for antics got the better of him.

        </p>
        <p>
          And when I say antics, I mean it; Pushkin had dog-like energy. He would run about the house to wake you up. You could play fetch with him. In the summer, you could even take him outside for a walk - though it was more like the cat was walking you. So it’s with that we all had great concern when Pushkin suddenly lost energy a few weeks ago.

        </p>
        <p>
          Pushkin lost over 40% of his weight in under three weeks. First it was multiple shots a day. Then came surgery and a feeding tube. More tests. Multiple vets, sometimes hours away, without luck.

        </p>
        <p>
          Pushkin passed away at Cornell Veterinary today by the side of both my parents, cause still unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I think about the impact of this cat, it’s almost silly. I would often opt to fly east over family visiting me just to see him. He was the center of attention for everyone there. It’s been hard to call home to such a somber quiet place, with long gaps of dead-air filled only by Skipper’s persistent distressed mewing, longing for his lost brother.

        </p>
        <p>
          Siberians easily live to 15; Pushkin was 6. I like to joke and say my parents replaced me with a cat, but no one expected the house to feel empty again quite so soon.
