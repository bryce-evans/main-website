                <p>
                    I started learning out of spite. 
                    When I went to study engineering in university, I became surrounded with hearing 
                    Chinese for the first time in my life - or any language for that matter. It was culture
                    shock. It was annoying. Offensive. It felt intentionally exclusive, as if to set up a 
                    barrier as a way to speak behind someone's back right to their face. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    And it was everywhere. Not just in dining halls and dorms, but also office hours, where
                    overhearing conversations was helpful and welcome. One night while playing cards with friends,
                    the entire conversation was in Chinese. "Can you all just use English?" I asked. "But she is
                    Chinese and I am Chinese, so it just makes sense that we use Chinese," I got back. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After some back and forth with my obvious frustration at being excluded from conversation, I
                    was given a deal. No one wanted to translate everything for me, but if I learned properly, 
                    people were more than willing to tell me the meaning of words.  "Done!" I declared. It was easy 
                    enough. Now whatever the conversation was, I would be able to follow. I didn't care much at 
                    all for the semantics around what were my exact intentions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so I started learning out of spite. No more secrets or hidden conversation staring me in the face,
                    I was "learning" and so people had to explain. But along the way, something else happened: Mandarin wasn't
                    hard. This language that Americans hold up as the hardest of all languages, this insurmountable challenge, 
                    was actually not hard. I was told words and remembered them. 
                </p>
